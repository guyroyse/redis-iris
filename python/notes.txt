Must install protobuf before installing the Python dependencies.

The version of skl2onnx in requirements.txt doesn't compile with protobuf 3.11 but works with 3.10. This looks to be an open issue:
https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2481

Needed to downgrade to 3.10.1. Using brew install, this is nigh impossible. Used this blog post and some gumption:

Also look at keras2onnx and tf2onnx.

https://pypi.org/project/onnxmltools/ looks promising too. Apple Core ML to ONNX to RedisAI.

redismod has AI but not ONNX.
redisai has ONNX

redis-cli -x AI.MODELSET iris ONNX CPU < logreg_iris.onnx

The -x makes all the differnece.
